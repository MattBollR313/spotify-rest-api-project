<h2>Spotify REST API Project</h2>
This project was made for the first course for the software engineering master's program at Penn State World Campus in August 2021. 
This program involves the use of Java, Swing, and Maven in order to display information about an artist or song which is pulled
from Spotify's API. By using Maven for managing dependencies, a dependency was utilized which simplifies the integration with Spotify's
API. Throughout the project, I gained experience building an application that hits a REST API alongside learning about Maven and how it 
functions to help simplify the development process.
